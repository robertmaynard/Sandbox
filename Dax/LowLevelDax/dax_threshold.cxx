  /*
  Execute the first step of the threshold algorithm

  Here are the steps that Dax takes to launch the ThresholdClassify worklet

  1. We construct a DispatcherMapCell since the worklet type is
     WorkletMapCell. We must give the dispatcher an instance of the worklet
     since the constructor requires a min and max value

  2. We pass to the dispatcher Invoke method all the parameters, so that we
     fulfill the requirements of the control signature. Invoke can in theory
     handle an arbitrary number of parameters. Since DispatcherMapCell is
     a very simple dispatcher it just forwards the invoke to the parent
     class dax::cont::dispatch::DispatcherBase which does all the work

     A. DispatcherBase uses dax::cont::dispatch::VerifyUserArgLength to
        make sure at compile time that the number of items passed to the
        Invoke method matches the number of parameters in the worklets
        ControlSignature. It will state specifically if you have too many or not
        enough items.

     B. Create the concept map binding between the user provided arguments
        and the ControlSignature requirements for each argument.

        We construct a dax::cont::internal::binding<InvocationSignature>
        object around all the user arguments that have been passed in.
        The bindings will iterate over each argument and try to find a valid
        concept that match the user type with the ControlSignature requested
        type (Field, Topology, etc). At this point we have only constructed
        the required dax::cont::arg::ConceptMap specialization for each user
        argument. See the Control Binding section, for more documentation on
        what happens during this process.

        This binding object is what we will wrap pass to Step E as the arguments
        it should use in the execution environment.

        You can read more about how the resolution of ConceptMaps happen
        by reading "Understanding the Dax Dispatcher" mainly the Control Binding
        section
          https://gist.github.com/robertmaynard/6038997 (markdown format)
          http://www.daxtoolkit.org/index.php/Understanding_Dispatch


      C. DispatcherBase invokes dax::cont::dispatch::CollectCount with the
        given domain ( Cells in this case ) to determine the number of iterations
        the worklet should be scheduled. The Domain of a worklet details
        what parameters we should trust for length. For example if our domain
        is cell's we should only trust grid class and arrays whose concept for
        that position state it is cell field to get the length.

     D. We allocate execution memory given the size from Step C.
        If an array ControlSignature marks it as Input it is presumed to have
        already been allocated.


     E. We wrap the users worklet inside a dax::exec::internal::Functor
        with the bindings created in Step B. This provides a common
        interface to all worklets. You can consider the bindings classes
        that functor has been given to work similar as a zip iterator plus
        meta data info about each values type to allow automatic conversion
        basic to the correct type, which the dax::exec infrastructure will use
        to construct the proper exec objects for the worklet.


    3.  We pass the exec::Functor over to the DeviceAdapter that the dispatcher
        is templated on. Specifically we pass it to the Schedule method
        of the DeviceAdapter. Each DeviceAdapter will have two Schedule
        methods. One accepts a dax::Id which is the number of instances
        to execute in parallel. The second takes in a dax::Id3 which is
        considered to be the max values for a triple nested for loop which
        to run the worklet on.

          DeviceAdapter::Schedule( Functor f, dax::Id size ) is roughly equal to:
            for(dax::Id i=0; i < size; ++i )
              {
              f( dax::Id(i) );
              }

          DeviceAdapter::Schedule( Functor f, dax::Id3 ijk ) is roughly equal to:
            for(dax::Id i=0; i < ijk[0]; ++i )
              for(dax::Id j=0; i < ijk[1]; ++j )
                for(dax::Id k=0; i < ijk[2]; ++k )
                  {
                  f( dax::Id3(i,j,k) );
                  }

        In both cases the users worklet doesn't need to know what scheduling
        algorithm was used to execute the worklet, as that is contained
        in the execution environment infrastructure that calls the users worklet.


        Dax Device Adapters are located in the following locations:
          Serial - dax/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterSerial.h
          TBB - dax/tbb/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h
          CUDA - dax/cuda/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h
          OpenMP - dax/openmp/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h

        The CUDA and OpenMP both forward to thrust specific device adapters.
          Thrust Device Adapter - dax/thrust/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterAlgorithmThrust.h

  4. For each iteration the device adapter will call dax::exec::internal::Functor.
     This class controls the conversion of the iteration index into arguments
     for the actual worklet.

     We create a temporary instance of all the ConceptMap that we have created
     in Step 2B. This is required because on shared memory backends the
     instance of Functor is shared and we don't want two threads
     using the same ConceptMap or they will write / read from the wrong memory
     positions.

     Next we will go through all the ConceptMaps that have been created
     and call the GetExecArg() method of each storing the created object.

     Execution binding is composed of two parts. The execution argument class like
     FieldPortal or FieldConstant which I will call ExecArg, and the binding class
     like BindDirect or BindCellPoints which describes how the ExecArg will be
     used by the worklet.

     The most basic binding is BindDirect which means that for each iteration
     of the functor we will query the ExecArg with the index we are currently on.
     For a more complicated binding like BindCellPoints we have have to query
     he ExecArg for each point of the given cell and return a container class
     ( dax::exec::CellField ) that holds all the field values for the points.

     The issue with BindCellPoints is that it was only given the point field and
     have no information on the topology that we are currently iterating.
     We solve this problem by passing in the entire signature for all the
     worklets parameters as a template signature, and when we construct the
     Binding object we extract the Topology argument which will tell BindCellPoints
     how many points it should allocate for.

     Here are some examples of what GetExecArg() will return for different
     combinations of a ControlSignature and user parameter

       ControlSignatuire + user param = binding + field
        Field(In|Out) + ArrayHandle == dax::exec::arg::BindDirect + dax::exec::arg::FieldPortal
        Field(In|Out) + int ==  dax::exec::arg::BindDirect +  dax::exec::arg::FieldConstant
        Field(Point|In) + ArrayHandle == dax::exec::arg::BindCellPoints + dax::exec::arg::FieldPortal
        Field(Point|In) + int == dax::exec::arg::BindCellPoints + dax::exec::arg::FieldConstant


     We call each ExecArg operator() with the given value we had been passed.
     This can be a flat index (Id) or a 3d range index. It will return an
     execution object that will be passed directly to the worklet.

    Here are some examples of what operator() will return,

    ControlSignatuire + user param = worklet value
      Field(In|Out) + ArrayHandle<float> == float
      Field(In|Out) + int ==  int
      Field(Point|In) + ArrayHandle<float> == dax::exec::CellField<float, CellType>
      Field(Point|In) + int == dax::exec::CellField<int, CellType>


    We finally execute the worklet with the values that had been returned by
    the operator(). We iterate over the ExecArgs calling the SaveExecutionResult()
    method on each. Since some ExecArg return reference objects, they have local
    storage that needs to be written back into global memory

  /*
  Execute the second step of the threshold algorithm

  Here are the steps that Dax takes to launch the worklet::ThresholdTopology worklet

  1. We construct a DispatcherGenerateTopology since the worklet type is
     WorkletGenerateTopology. The GenerateTopology Dispatcher requires two
     things, the first being the count array tell it how many cells each
     input cell is going to generate, and the optional worklet parameter.

  2. We call Invoke on an instance of the dispatcher passing it all the
     parameters it requires to fulfill the ControlSignature of the worklet.

     A. We call DeviceAdapter::InclusiveScan on the Count Array held by the
        DispatcherGenerateTopology.

     B. Release the count array if that option has been set.

     C. Call DeviceAdapter::UpperBounds on the output of Step 2B.
        Release the inclusive scan ouput

     D. Compute the VisitIndex if needed. The VisitIndex is used when you
        need to iterate multiple times over the same cell. each time you
        visit that cell you want a integer value stating how many times you
        already have been to that cell. this is needed when doing something
        like tetrahedralization

     E. Invoke our derived parents BasicInvoke method with a permutation on the grid.
        The BasicInvoke will verify the user has passed in all the proper
        arguments to fulfill the ControlSignature of the worklet.

        This worklets only goal is to create the new topology for the output grid.
        By topology I mean something very similar to the vtkCellArray entry
        for a single cell ( all the point indicies it uses. )

       i) See the Classify Worklet documentation, except the domain this
            time is PermutedCells ( Which you should consider equal to
            Cell for for Step C), and Step E we call the basic
            DeviceAdapter::Schedule( dax::Id ) since we aren't working
            on all the cells of a uniform grid.

     F. Next we check if the user wants to remove duplicates. Currently the
        duplicate removal is a two step affair. This allows us to store
        a mask that can be reused when thresholding other point fields, instead
        of having to recompute it each time.

        Note: All the following algorithms like Copy, Sort, Unique are
        implemented as static calls on the DeviceAdapter.
        Dax Device Adapters are located in the following locations:
          Serial - dax/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterSerial.h
          TBB - dax/tbb/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h
          CUDA - dax/cuda/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h
          OpenMP - dax/openmp/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterTBB.h

        The CUDA and OpenMP both forward to thrust specific device adapters.
          Thrust Device Adapter - dax/thrust/cont/internal/DeviceAdapterAlgorithmThrust.h

        i) The first step is computing a point mask. We construct an array
           of the same size as the number of points in the input grid and
           iterate over the CellConnections ( think vtkCellArray ) ids of the
           output grid writing writing out 1 in the index for point ids we see

           for example:
            number of input points = 5
            CellConnections values = [1,3,4]
            mask = [0,1,0,1,1]

        ii) The second step is to convert that mask and original point coordinates
            into a reduced point coordinate set while keeping the relative ordering
            of the points intact.

            To this we do the following:
              Run Stream Compact on the Points using the Mask which will extract
              the point coordinates that are valid, the result of the stream
              compact becomes the output geometries point coordinates.

              Copy the output grids cell topology to a temporary array
              Sort the ids in the temporary array
              Unique the ids in the temporary array
              LowerBounds on the temporary array writing back into the
              output grids cell topology

              The last step is what transform the original cells in the
              output grid cell cell connections array from old indice values
              to the new reduced values.

          Note: this might not be the fastest point reduction algorithm, and
          we are interested in somebody researching other ways to find the
          reduced set of point ids.
