Todo:

6. Use a better compiler detector like boost does

Finished:

1. Switch over to boost::tuple
2. add in code to handle pre processor magic
3. add in try / compile for c++11 support to determine, what magic we should use
4. correct pass by reference to be used whenever possible
4a. front args need to be pass by reference.
4b. packed args need to be pass by const reference.
5. Switched over to fusion for majority of work.
7. find a better algorithm for flatten, can we use views?
